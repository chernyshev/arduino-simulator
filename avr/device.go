// RAM (from Random-Access Memory)

// Flash memory in microcontroller-based systems is part of its ROM. The flash memory is where the system's firmware is stored to be executed. For example, think of the famous Blink.ino sketch: when we compile this sketch, we create a binary file that is later stored in the flash memory of an Arduino board. The sketch is then executed when the board is powered on.
// RAM in microcontroller-based systems is where the system's temporary data or run-time data is stored; for example, the variables created by functions of a program. RAM in microcontrollers usually is SRAM; this is a type of RAM that uses a flip-flop to store one bit of data. There is also another type of RAM that can be found in microcontrollers: DRAM.
// EEPROM In microcontroller-based systems, Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory, or EEPROM, is also part of its ROM; actually, Flash memory is a type of EEPROM. The main difference between Flash memory and EEPROM is how they are managed; EEPROM can be managed at the byte level (write or erased) while Flash can be managed at the block level.
